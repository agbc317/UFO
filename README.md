# UFO

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to create a website that is able to filter through UFO data in order to find specific subsets of sightings. 

## Results:

In order to find a specific sighting you can enter search terms into the different filter input elements on the left side of the page.

To search for all triangle shaped sightings you would add triangle to the Shape filter element.

To refine this further you could search for a specific state in the State filter element.

## Summary:

One drawback to this page is that you can not filter by duration. This could be fixed by adding duration filter element.

- One reccomendation that I have for this webpage would be to add a submission form to allow users to add their own sighting. This would allow for more people to add and to make sure that the webpage has as much information as possible. 
- Another reccomendation that I have for this webpage is to add a forum to the page in order to allow for the users to find a community and to have more discussions about the UFO sightings.
